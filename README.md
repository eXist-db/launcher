# Blueprint for componentized eXistdb apps

## What is it?

An 'componentized' webapp in the eXistdb context is one that uses W3C Web Components specifically using
the Polymer polyfill library.

## What's in the box

* a common minimal directory structure (more dirs can be added of course)
* all needed configuration files
* useful development tooling (bower, gulp, Polymer CLI, Ant)

NOTE: the tooling seems diverse as it's using so many different tools but all have their purpose which is explained further down.
It's a goal of this app template to simplify the usage of all these tools by preconfiguring them and give you the necessary information
 about their usage.

## Before you start

What will be needed up-front:

* an installation of eXistdb (3.0 or above recommended)
* a nodejs installation (see below for instructions) 
* if using Polymer an installation of the [Polymer CLI](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/start/toolbox/set-up) (highly recommended)
* Apache Ant configured

## Setting up a new application

Don't be scared by this list. It can be done in 3 minutes. 

1. download this blueprint as a zip
1. unpack the zip in your favorite development folder
1. this creates a folder with starts with 'existdb-launcher-'
1. rename the folder to give it your new projectname
1. execute ´npm install' to install bower and gulp support. Note: do NOT bower install yet. This will be done by Polymer CLI. However if you don't intend to use that you'll have to setup bower yourself.
1. execute ´ant init´ to name your new app. This will put the new name into all needed config files
 
After these steps a full deployable xar application has been created. Your projectname was filled into all relevant place to configure the app. Of course you
can further refine the default controller.xql, add authentication, data and xqueries and so on.


## Setting up Polymer

Note: you do NOT have to setup bower manually. This will be done by Polymer CLI automatically.

For Polymer development is [Polymer CLI](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/start/toolbox/set-up) is highly recommended 
and assumed to be present for the remainder of this document. Please visit the link for installation instructions.

Once you got that running execute these:

1. execute ```polymer init``` to setup for Polymer development (see also below)
1. CLI will ask which kind of template shall be used. Choose one.
1. CLI will ask for name and description
1. CLI will ask to overwrite index.html. Use 'Y' if ´init´ was called for the first time otherwise 'n'
1. CLI will ask to overwrite README.md. Choose 'n' to keep this documentation or get the Polymer generated one. (you'll likely use that for own remarks anyway later)
1. You will need to manually adapt the ´<link rel="import"...´ statements in the index.html file generated. (haven't yet found a way to adapt those)

 
## Where to go from here

After finishing the above instructions you'll have the setup completed.

Time to go for a test and build the xar with:

```ant [xar]```

Then:

1. deploy that xar into your running eXistdb instance via the packagemanager.
2. open up the app. You should see a simple documentation page not saying much except everything went fine and we have our app alive.

From now on you might want to use ```gulp watch```to automatically sync your local changes
into eXistdb. This is a very fast and convenient way to develop web components with eXistdb.

CAUTION: there one nifty detail to watch. Your html files that are hosting (importing components via html imports)
MUST be well-formed html files following the xhtml rules ( meta and link tags have to use closing syntax '/>'). 

The Web Components itself are not well-formed markup and are stored as binary HTML in eXistdb.

For more info about the gulp file see below.

### Starting to work

Your work starts by modifying index.html to probably adapting the script and link pathes if necessary. The generated
index.html is a standard Polymer documentation page. I usually copy that to 'doc.html' to not loose it and start modifying
the index.html.

Once index.html is in shape open up your main component file which will be file you created during polymer init (e.g. my-app.html)
and check the polymer import. This is usually not right in this setting and needs to be adapted once to start with 'bower_components'.

You can now go on with actually implementing your Web Component.

### Going on

Eventually you'll need a new component. Just created new ones via ```polymer init``` again to quickly create one. Don't forget to import
it whereever its used. 

happy hackin

## Tooling Reference

### What gulp does for you

[gulpjs](http://gulpjs.com/) is a JavaScript build tool and knows hundreds of 'tasks' to help client-side development.

For eXistdb application development there is a custom existdb plugin (task) that can talk to eXistdb and deploy files
from a local disk into eXistdb.

#### Commands

```
gulp deploy
```

will transfer all local files on disk to the target collection in eXistdb. If you've used ´ant init` the target collection
will already be configured for you.

IMPORTANT: the app MUST be deployed once into eXistdb before ´gulp deploy´ or `gulp watch` are run. This is to setup
the application correctly (creating collection, users etc.).

```
gulp watch
```

can be started in a terminal once (in the root of your project) and will then watch all files on disk and deploy them into eXistdb
ONCE THEY'VE CHANGED. This is very convenient if you prefer a workflow 'from workspace to database'.

### What [Polymer CLI](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/start/toolbox/set-up) does for you

Polymer CLI is a powerful tool when working with Polymer. 

#### Commands:

```
polymer init
```

With this command you can create a single new Polymer Web Component or even a whole new application. It must be executed
in the root of your project. 

IMPORANT: when run initially the Polymer CLI will download all JavaScript dependencies it needs for Polymer development. When run
to create new components later on (after setup) you should answer all 'overwrite' questions of the CLI with 'n' to keep the originals.

```
polymer serve -o
```

can be used to start a local server that open the index page. This is fine for a quick view if the component is running
as expected. For serious development i recommend to use gulp for deployment (see above).

```
polymer build
```


will create a production version of all your Polymer Web Components compressed into index.html. It also will remove
all unneeded dependencies from 'bower_components'. This command should be executed once the app is ready for production as
 it reduces the footprint dramatically.
 
```
polymer test
```

will run Polymer tests found in directory 'test'. 

NOTE: this is not working perfectly for now so please be aware that it might fail due to browser loading/shutdown problems. The
actuals tests however should pass. We'll have to look for a more stable solution in the future.

The relevant test framework can be found here: [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester)

### What [Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) does for you

Ant (as always in eXistdb app development) does the final packaging as a xar app. In this app template the standard build.xml
is extended to wrap the ´build` command of the Polymer CLI when the target 'production-xar' is called.

```
ant init
```

As described above this must be called once you create your project to rename the relevant parts of the various config-files.


```
ant xar
```

This is the default and creates a xar file for deployment into eXistdb. Run this and use eXistdb Package Manager to
install the app into eXistdb before ever calling ´gulp deploy` or `gulp watch`.

```
ant production-xar
```

will call ´polymer init´ to make sure all Web Components are optimized before packaging the xar. This is highly recommended to prepare
your app for production deployment.



### What bower does for you

bowerjs is a client-side dependency management tool. It's widely adapted in the web development world. It works with a 'bower.json' file
that contains all necessary information. By default all client-side dependencies are kept in a directory called 'bower_components'. In app template
this file will be created by Polymer CLI.

bower.json will also serve as a meta-information provider when you want to distribute a component
for use with bower in an external application. If you're interested in this use case please be aware
that the ignores found in 'bower.json.ignores' are added to bower.json.

#### Commands

```
bower install
```

this will read the 'bower.json' file and load all dependencies found there into the local 'bower_components' directory.
Note that it will only load dependencies if they are not yet present so it does some caching.

```
bower search [string]
```

this can be used to localize a dependency you want to use. It will return a list of available resources which then can be installed.

```
bower install --save [resource]
```

this will download the resource and put it into 'bower_components' for usage. Please always use ´--save´ to store the dependency
in bower.json. if you're installing a development time dependency use ´--save-dev´ instead.



### Notes on setting up nodejs

Note: This is a one-timer - you can skip this step if you got mpm on your system already.

Though not strictly required for development it is recommended that you have an installation of nodejs on your system.
It is recommended to use ['nvm'](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install nodejs as this eases the process of installation and 
allows to keep different versions of it on your system without conflicts.

Nodejs is used within this project to drive the gulp tasks. These allow to:
 
 * build CSS from less
 * sync your local files into eXistdb with `gulp deploy` or 
 * sync your changed files into eXistdb with `gulp watch`
 
Please refer to the nvm page for installation instruction or use an installation method described
on the nodejs.org homepage.

## Final remark

If you find problems with the information provided above please use the issue-tracker and file a ticket. Same applies to
 extensions of the app template that you'd like to suggest.
